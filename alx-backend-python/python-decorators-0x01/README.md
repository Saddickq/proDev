# Project Description
This project focuses on mastering Python decorators to enhance database operations in Python applications. Through hands-on tasks, learners will create custom decorators to log queries, handle connections, manage transactions, retry failed operations, and cache query results. The tasks are designed to simulate real-world challenges, providing learners with an in-depth understanding of Pythonâ€™s capabilities for dynamic and reusable code in database management.

## Learning Objectives
By completing these tasks, professional developers will:

1. Deepen their knowledge of Python decorators and how they can be used to create reusable, efficient, and clean code.
2. Enhance database management skills by automating repetitive tasks like connection handling, logging, and caching.
3. Implement robust transaction management techniques to ensure data integrity and handle errors gracefully.
4. Optimize database queries by leveraging caching mechanisms to reduce redundant calls.
5. Build resilience into database operations by implementing retry mechanisms for transient errors.
6. Apply best practices in database interaction for scalable and maintainable Python applications.

### Requirements
1. Python 3.8 or higher installed.
2. SQLite3 database setup with a users table for testing.
3. A working knowledge of Python decorators and database operations.
4. Familiarity with Git and GitHub for project submission.
5. Strong problem-solving skills and attention to detail.
